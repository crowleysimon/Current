# Current (working title)

An RSS reader with a focus on design, typography, and gestures.

The app is written entirely in Kotlin, using Clean Architecture and MVVM.

Still very early in development and as I build this in my spare time progress is kinda slow.

## Planned Features

* Clean and Simple Design with a focus on Typography
* Animations and Gestures
* Seamless Theme switching
* Feedly Integration
* Inoreader Integration
* Background syncing
